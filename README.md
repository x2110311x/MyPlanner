## Inspiration
A few months ago, I found myself looking for a planner app to better manage my time and things I need to get done.
Nothing I found matched what I was looking for, and was always missing some piece.

I decided it was time to make my own.

## What it does
The concept is to have a app that keeps your tasks and lets you mark a few key items.

 - Task Start/Assigned Date
 - Task Due Date
 - Planned Date/Time to work on task
 - Tags/Category
 - Task Priority
 
 I also wanted it to be able to have a calendar view of my tasks, and an export to my Google Calendar

 To further help with getting tasks done, I also wanted to be able to add a timer to track how long tasks take, and possibly implement a Pomodoro approach with notifications to take breaks.

## How I built it
The app was built in Android Studio using Kotlin.
Data is stored using Google Cloud Firestore, with user authentication handled by Firestore Authentication
## Challenges I ran into
I basically had to teach myself everything I did this weekend.
 - I have NEVER done any mobile app development. I've only worked in the PC space.
	 - This includes writing in Kotlin.
 - I've never worked in FireStore. I've briefly touched into MongoDB before, so I was familar with the NoSQL
   concept, but it was much different than the relational databases I am used to.
   

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I taught myself very basic Android app development, some basic Kotlin, and built a prototype, but functioning app in our timeframe.

## What I learned
As previously mentioned, everything I've done in this project was learned this weekend.
I've never written or even looked at Kotlin before.
I've never even messed around inside Android Studio.
I've never touched Google Firebase/Firestore.
## What's next for MyPlanner
There's plenty functionality that still needs added to the app, and things tweaked.
Luckily, I have a very practical use for this app, so the drive to continue it will be there.
